#  Face Recognition

Facial recognition is a biometric software application capable of uniquely identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing patterns based on the person's facial contours. Facial recognition is mostly used for security purposes, though there is increasing interest in other areas of use. In fact, facial recognition technology has received significant attention as it has potential for a wide range of application related to law enforcement as well as other enterprises.

Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use it for really stupid stuff like applying  [digital make-up](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py)  (think 'Meitu'):

You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:

## Requirements

 - Python 3
 - OpenCV
 - TensorFlow
 - Keras
 - pandas
 - NumPy

# To Run The Code

  To run the face detection, open face detection floader and run
 - Image.py to give image as input
 - Video.py to give video as input
 - Live.py to get input from your webcam
 
 To run age & gender code , open Age & gender floater and run the Age&Gender.py

To run Emotion Recognition code , open Emotion Recognition and 

 - First train the dataset(the dataset should be in .csv), and it can be trained from Training.py code.
 - After training run Emotion Recognition.py
